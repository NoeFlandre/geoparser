## Models

- **hybrid**: resolver=dguzh/geo-all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- **population-0.3**: resolver=dguzh/geo-all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- **population-0.5**: resolver=dguzh/geo-all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- **population-1.0**: resolver=dguzh/geo-all-MiniLM-L6-v2

Resolution is scored on the gold spans, supplied to both pipelines
through ManualRecognizer, so the resolvers are judged on the same
toponyms and a difference cannot be an artefact of recognition.

A gold toponym a pipeline did not place is charged the maximum
possible error rather than dropped, so resolving less cannot improve
a score. The shared abstention threshold is stated above. Models
can have different similarity scales, so the threshold is part of
the experiment and should be considered when comparing resolvers.

AUC is a log-scaled summary of the whole error distribution, lower
being better. Its normalization is this harness's own, so compare
runs of this harness rather than published AUC figures.
